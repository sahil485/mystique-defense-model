(DONE) use bucket to create "slopes" from the start value of a bucket to the end value
    -> manual discretization of the signal
    -> do it with the thresholded signal

(DONE) skew and kurtosis

- try bandpass filtering (preprocessing) - 50 Hz to 250 Hz - scipy

- use zero padding for machine learning when inputting the thresholded signal into the model -> indicates signal length
